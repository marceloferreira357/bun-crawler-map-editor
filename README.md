# Bun Crawler Map Editor

The **Bun Crawler Map Editor** is a tool designed to create and edit tiled maps for the **Bun Crawler** game. This editor uses the **16x16 DungeonTileset II** sprites by **0x72** to help you design maps that can be directly integrated into the game.

## Features

- **Sprite Loading:** Automatically loads the 0x72 sprite sheet for easy map creation.
- **Map Creation:** Design your custom map using the provided tile set.
- **JSON Export:** Generates a `.json` file representing your map, which can then be added directly to the Bun Crawler game.

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) - A fast JavaScript runtime for all-in-one JavaScript projects.
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) - A next-generation frontend tooling for fast builds and an optimal development experience.
